# DOOM Repository

This repository now includes a simple script to install and run **Freedoom** using the
`chocolate-doom` engine. Freedoom is an open-source game that is compatible with the
classic DOOM engine, providing free game data.

## Playing DOOM

Run the script from this repository:

```bash
bash play_doom.sh
```

The script will install the required packages (`chocolate-doom` and `freedoom`) using
`apt-get` if they are not already installed, then launch the game.
